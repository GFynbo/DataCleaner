# DataCleaner

## Overview
This script simply grabs all the files in the directory and any sub-directories that are
`.csv` files. It takes the files, removes a few columns and cleans the date/time to specifically
digits. After this it uses regular expressions and the Pandas to rename and save the cleaned files.
